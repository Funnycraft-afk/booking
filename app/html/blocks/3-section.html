                            It was very nice hotel with cleanliness. Staff behavior was good and polite. They
                            welcome us very well. Issue was only that Lift was not in working and we were allotted
                            to 3rd floor and amenities articles were in corner of gallery which were giving bad
                            feeling. Breakfast was good and support of the staff was also very nice. Location is not
                            good as per atmosphere, it is very nearby most of the popular places but self location
                            in a narrow street is not good. Overall it was a good experience and could recommend.
